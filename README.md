## About

Parrot is basically a simple utility for me to practice a few things and will maybe grow over the years or stagnate entirely

- Helping me debug requests
- Best practices from a Go perspective for handling things like env variables and the rest
- Trying to use as few dependencies as possible (thanks to the go standard library)
- Multi stage docker containers
- Parroting values back from IP requests

If you have feedback hit me up [On Twitter](https://twitter.com/dannolan)

## Availability

- You can hit up the parrot service _HERE_
